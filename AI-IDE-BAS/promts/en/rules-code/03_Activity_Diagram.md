#### 4.5.3. Diagram Structure

##### 4.5.3.1. Title and Settings
plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Segoe UI"
skinparam defaultFontSize 10
skinparam backgroundColor #FFFFFF

title Process Name from User Story


##### 4.5.3.2. Swimlanes (Responsibility Lanes)
plantuml
|Role 1|
start
:Action 1;

|Role 2|
:Action 2;

|System|
:Automatic Action;


##### 4.5.3.3. Structural Organization
- **Start**: mandatory starting point
- **Actions**: description of specific steps
- **Decisions**: logic branching points
- **Concurrency**: fork/join for concurrent actions
- **Completion**: end or stop

---

#### 4.5.4. Quality Metrics

##### 4.5.4.1. Target Indicators:
- **Flow Coverage**: 100% of steps from the Use Case are represented
- **Logical Grouping**: use of swimlanes for roles
- **Decision Detailing**: every 'if' has all possible outcomes
- **Concurrency**: concurrent processes are identified and modeled
- **Error Handling**: minimum of 2 error handling flows

##### 4.5.4.2. Scoring System:
- **Excellent Quality**: ≥90% compliance with metrics + full Use Case coverage
- **Good Quality**: 70-89% compliance with metrics
- **Needs Improvement**: <70% compliance with metrics

##### 4.5.4.3. Specific Metrics:
- Number of swimlanes: 2-6 (according to roles from the Use Case)
- Number of decisions: 1-5 for every 10 actions
- Nesting depth: no more than 3 levels
- Parallel flows: all possible parallel processes are identified

---

#### 4.5.5. Validation Rules

##### 4.5.5.1. Automatic Checks:

✓ Starts with @startuml, ends with @enduml
✓ Has a single start point
✓ All paths lead to end/stop
✓ Every 'if' has corresponding then/else branches
✓ All forks have corresponding joins
✓ Swimlanes correspond to roles from the Use Case
✓ Actions contain active verbs
✓ No "dangling" actions without input/output
✓ Decisions are formulated as questions


##### 4.5.5.2. Semantic Checks:

✓ Every action corresponds to a step from the Use Case
✓ The sequence of actions is logically connected
✓ Roles in swimlanes correspond to actors from the User Story
✓ All alternative flows from the Use Case are represented
✓ Error handling covers main exceptions

#### 4.5.6. Basic Template

plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Segoe UI"
skinparam defaultFontSize 10

#### 4.5.10. Integration with Artifacts

##### 4.5.10.1. Connection with User Story:
- **Roles in swimlanes** = roles from "As a [role]"
- **Main flow** = implementation of "I want to [action]"
- **Diagram result** = achievement of "So that [benefit]"

##### 4.5.10.2. Connection with Use Case:
- **Main UC flow** = main sequence of actions
- **Alternative UC flows** = else/case branches
- **UC exceptions** = error handling blocks
- **UC preconditions** = conditions at the beginning of the diagram
- **UC postconditions** = states at end points

##### 4.5.10.3. Connection with Business Rules:
- **Decision rules** = conditions in if/switch
- **Business constraints** = validation blocks
- **Approval processes** = sequences in corresponding swimlanes

##### 4.5.10.4. Connection with technical artifacts:
- **API specification** = automated actions
- **Database schema** = data persistence actions
- **Sequence diagrams** = detailing interactions between swimlanes

#### 4.5.11. Standard Patterns

##### 4.5.11.1. "Request-Processing-Response" Pattern
plantuml
|User|
start
:Send request;

|System|
:Receive request;
:Validate data;

if (Data valid?) then (yes)
  :Process request;
  :Form response;
else (no)
  :Form error;
endif

|User|
:Receive response;
end


##### 4.5.11.2. "Approval Workflow" Pattern
plantuml
|Initiator|
start
:Create request;

|Manager|
:Review request;

if (Approve?) then (yes)
  if (Amount > limit?) then (yes)
    |Director|
    :Final approval;
    
    if (Approve?) then (yes)
      |System|
      :Execute operation;
    else (no)
      :Reject;
      stop
    endif
  else (no)
    |System|
    :Execute operation;
  endif
else (no)
  :Reject;
  stop
endif

|Initiator|
:Receive notification;
end


##### 4.5.11.3. "Batch Processing" Pattern
plantuml
|System|
start
:Get item list;

repeat
  :Take next item;
  
  fork
    :Process item;
  fork again
    :Record progress;
  end fork
  
repeat while (Unprocessed items exist?)

:Generate report;
:Send completion notification;
end


##### 4.5.11.4. "Error Recovery" Pattern
plantuml
|System|
start
:retry_count = 0;

repeat
  :Attempt to perform operation;
  
  if (Operation successful?) then (yes)
    :Record result;
    end
  else (no)
    :retry_count++;
    
    if (retry_count < max_retries?) then (yes)
      :Wait interval;
    else (no)
      :Log critical error;
      :Notify administrator;
      stop
    endif
  endif
repeat while (retry_count < max_retries?)

#### 4.5.12. Swimlanes and Roles

##### 4.5.12.1. Swimlanes usage rules:
1. **One swimlane = one role/system**
2. **Maximum 6 swimlanes** (for readability)
3. **Roles taken from User Story and Use Case**
4. **Systems separated from human roles**

##### 4.5.12.2. Standard swimlanes:
plantuml
|User|        // Main role from User Story
|System|             // Automated processes
|Administrator|       // Management actions
|External System|     // Integrations
|Database|         // Only for complex processes


##### 4.5.12.3. Transitions between swimlanes:
- Control transfer = transition to action in another swimlane
- Parallel work = fork with actions in different swimlanes
- Synchronization = merge of actions from different swimlanes

---

#### 4.5.13. Typical Errors and How to Avoid Them

##### 4.5.13.1. Overly Technical Detail
❌ **Incorrect:**
plantuml
:Execute SQL SELECT query on users table;
:Deserialize JSON response;
:Update Redux store;


✅ **Correct:**
plantuml
:Get user data;
:Process received information;
:Update display;


##### 4.5.13.2. Mixing Abstraction Levels
❌ **Incorrect:**
plantuml
:Click "Send" button;
:Validate email address;
:Send HTTP POST request;
:Show success message;


✅ **Correct:**
plantuml
:Initiate form submission;
:Check data correctness;
:Transfer data to system;
:Notify about result;


##### 4.5.13.3. Lack of Error Handling
❌ **Incorrect:**
plantuml
:Send request;
:Receive response;
:Show result;


✅ **Correct:**
plantuml
:Send request;

if (Request successful?) then (yes)
  :Show result;
else (no)
  :Show error message;
endif


##### 4.5.13.4. Incorrect Concurrency Usage
❌ **Incorrect:** (sequential actions as parallel)
plantuml
fork
  :Authenticate;
fork again
  :Get profile data;
end fork


✅ **Correct:**
plantuml
:Authenticate;

fork
  :Send welcome email;
fork again
  :Record audit event;
end fork

:Redirect to main page;
